"Course Planner" for a Computer Science department, allowing users to load, list, and retrieve course information, enhancing course management efficiency. It streamlines tasks by presenting an interactive menu and effectively organizing course data.

I tackled the problem through task decomposition and function design, utilizing data structures like vectors for efficient course data management. Proficiency in data structures is essential as it facilitates organized and optimized storage, amplifying the program's effectiveness in handling intricate tasks like course information management.    

I addressed challenges by analyzing problems systematically, debugging code, and seeking guidance from the support documents and online tuttoring. Utilizing step-by-step approaches and community input helped me overcome roadblocks effectively.    

This project expanded my software design approach, emphasizing modularization, efficient data structures, and user-friendly interactivity, resulting in organized, optimized, and user-centric program development.    

This project has shifted my programming approach towards prioritizing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I now emphasize clear function naming, modular design, and flexible data structures, leading to functional and future-ready programs.
